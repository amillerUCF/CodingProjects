These five programs consist of multiple problems
that were solved by using the technique of recursion. Some problems were solved iteratively though because recursion was either not needed or just that some problems were easier to solve without it. Recursion
is a very powerful technique that can reduce the 
number of lines for a solution and make code look
more professional, but this technique isn't always
easy to implement.
